- Bumped up to 1.0.1 because I messed up the manifest when uploading it to Thunderstore ðŸ’€
- Restructured Thunderstore folder hierarchy a bit.

### Known Issues

- Skill issue.

## 0.4.1

- Replaced hard-coded addressable strings with constants from ``RoR2BepInExPack.GameAssetPaths``.
- Improved `AddPingIconOverride`: now checks for an existing `PingInfoProvider` before adding a new one, and updates the sprite if already present.
- Encrusted Lockbox now correctly displays its ping icon (due to the `AddPingIconOverride` update).
- Logger is now properly initialized in `Awake()`, ensuring messages display correctly in the debug console.
- First release on Thunderstore!
